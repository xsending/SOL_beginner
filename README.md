## Description

This repository contains a program which runs a website and contains 3 functionalities:
1. Connecting to a phantom wallet
2. Generating a new Solana account
3. Transferring Sol into a Phantom wallet

These functionalities can be performed by just a click of a button, however these are all done in the solana devnet, thus no actual tokens are being used.

## Executing the program
To run this program, you can use Gitpod (www.gitpod.io/).
You can run the program through the terminal by using the "npm run dev" command and open the localhost network link provided from there.
The link will redirect you to a website where you can perform your tests.
Make sure to have a phantom wallet extension installed in your browser.
